**2021 Social Progress Index**

This file contains the 2021 Social Progress Index results and indicator data, along with historical results and indicator data for 2011-2020. The last tab contains indicator definitions by component. Dimensions, components, and indicators are color-coded by dimension (Basic Human Needs, Foundations of Wellbeing, and Opportunity). Indicator data are raw data; they do not reflect the transformative techniques used for calculation (see more below and in the 2021 Methodology Report).

Each year, Social Progress Imperative conducts a comprehensive review of all indicators included in the Social Progress Index framework to check data updates (which frequently include retroactive revisions) and whether new indicators have been published that are well-suited to describing social progress concepts. Such a review necessitates a recalculation of previously published versions of the Social Progress Index, as any removal or additions of indicators to the framework or changes due to retroactive revisions in data from the original data sources prevent comparability between previously published versions of the Social Progress Index and the 2021 Social Progress Index. Therefore, using the 2021 Social Progress Index framework and methodology, we provide comparable historical data for ten additional years of the Social Progress Index, from 2011 to 2020. To read more about our methodology, please see the 2021 Social Progress Imperative Methodology Report.

There are 168 countries for which we calculated Social Progress Index scores, in addition to the world. We showcase world performance first, which is calculated using the population-weighted indicator averages and in adherence with our methodology for calculating country scores. Below the first row are listed the ranked countries (Albania to Zimbabwe), followed by an additional 36 countries for which there is enough indicator data to allow for calculation of at least one component score. We do not present data for Afghanistan and Venezuela due to rapidly deteriorating conditions in these countries which are not yet fully captured across all indicators. The data and results for these four countries are available on demand.
